### Manually Creating Passwording (DB)
Ripple uses Password -> MD5 -> BCrypt Hash (10 rounds) for the password to login so in `users` table in `password_md5` column in db.

1. For Example: If you want to make your password `ExamplePassword87`, first you need to hash it as MD5. So the hash will be `df4s5fe65f456344f4re549` (You can hash your password at http://www.md5.cz/).
2. After hashing it, you'll still need to make it as BCrypt Hash (10 Rounds), you can use https://bcrypt-generator.com/ as BCrypt encryptor.
3. Put the MD5 Hash to `String to encrypt` box, change rounds to 10 and then click `Hash!` button.
4. You'll get the hash like `asdjslkfjlkUy89y32098y*(*@#&(*3y928hih32toij[][;gfgd` (which is our MD5 hash. `ExamplePassword87`)
5. Put your BCrypt hash in `password_md5` in your user data (DB).

Note: The BCrypt hash will be always different because BCrypt hashes it 10 times!

### Starting the Server
* Start MySQL (MySQL Server must be started and running)
* Start Redis Server, `Redis/redis-server.exe`
* Go to `lets` folder and run `python lets.py` (cmd.exe)
* Go to `pep.py` folder and run `python pep.py` (cmd.exe)
* Go to `avatar-server` folder and run `python avatar-server.py` (cmd.exe)
* Go to `api` folder and run `./API` (bash.exe/WSL)
* Go to `Frontend` folder and run `./frontend` (bash.exe/WSL)
* Go to `nginx-1.16.1` folder and run `nginx` (cmd.exe)

### Logging Into osu!
Before you login you have to create an account. You can create an account either by using the/from Frontend which is `i-need-to.click`(default) site. Or manually from database.
* Use a local database software to log into local database. I recommend <a href=https://www.heidisql.com/download.php>HeidiSQL</a> or <a href=https://www.devart.com/dbforge/mysql/studio/download.html>dbForge Studio</a>
* Log into local db. Then Click on RIPPLE db. Then head find `users`. And click on `Data` section above.
* In id `1000` fill-up your desired username, notes, and email. (It will have full owner/admin access)
* For Password follow that above section `#Manually Creating Passwording (DB)`
* Then you can login with your username/email and password.
